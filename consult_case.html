							<h4>Reliability study of track circuits in railway signalling infrastructure</h4>
						</header>
						<p>A major railway infrastructure company was looking at improving reliability of a particular type of track circuits. Track circuits are electrical devices very commonly used in railways for train detection.</p>
						<p>A particular type of track circuit prevalent throughout UKâ€™s railway infrastructure, which was the scope of the task. The task was to conduct a full scale detailed reliability study of this particular type of track circuit, the results of which were then to be used to determine failure modes, understand the root causes of these failure modes and how to mitigate them for achieving better reliability across the whole UK network.</p>
						<p>Result: The resulting study conducted analysed the failure modes of track circuits in detail along with detailed accounts of root causes and recommended solutions for improving reliability.</p>

							<h4>Database logic and process optimisation for vehicle manufacturing</h4>
						</header>
						<p>The key to good data analysis is accurate and real time source data with minimal process time, so that a clear picture of events can be seen and acted upon. </p>
						<p>A leading recreational vehicle manufacturer had assigned the project to conduct a detailed analysis of the types of warranties to compare with production quality. The aim was improve the accuracy of the data analysis, prove the link between other source factors that can affect production quality and highlight areas for improvement.</p>
						<p>A detailed study was conducted of the human processes involved in input of the source data and its extraction from the database in the procurement, after sale warranties and production departments. This was followed by a data comparison from numerous Database generated reports and study of the source data reporting process.</p>
						<p>Result: The project resulted in the database logic being redesigned to bring the reports into alignment and eliminate inaccuracies. The resulting data analysis standardisation between departments, improved processes and skill sharing, a new standardised electronic system resulted in a significant increase in communication between departments, leading to an increase in workflow efficiency and reduction in non-recurring costs.</p>
