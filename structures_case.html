							<h4>Structural analysis of an aircraft wing for safe transportation</h4>
						</header>
						<p>Aircraft are often assembled in several different locations, sometimes even over several countries. Since aircraft parts and sub-assemblies can be several tonnes in weight and enormous in size, safe transportation of big heavy aircraft sub-assemblies is a unique challenge</p>
						<p>Task was to conduct detailed structural analysis on a commercial aircraft wing assembly during all aspects of its transportation during the aircraft manufacturing and assembly process.
							The aim of this study was to demonstrate sufficient structural strength in the wing assembly to take transportation loads without experiencing any damage or plastic deformation.</p>
						<p>Detailed analysis was performed at all attachment points where the transportation jigs and tools attach to wing structure. This analysis supported the important criteria for the aircraft manufacturer to deliver wings safely and without any requirement for further modifications due to damage during transportation.</p>
						<p>Result: The analysis successfully deemed the wing structure safe for transportation. The numerical model based on MS Excel that was created can now also be easily modified in the future when structure is modified, or similar analysis is required to be done elsewhere. The study formed an important part of aircraft assembly operations for the manufacturer.</p>

							<h4>Composite aircraft structure Finite Element Analysis (FEA) validation</h4>
						</header>
						<p>A new aircraft design by a well-known aircraft manufacturer features a significant amount of composite materials in most major components. Computational analysis is used significantly in order to cut down on testing and validation costs.</p>
						<p>The task was to recreate a Finite Element Model (FEM) of a fully composite wing panel section with a bonded stringer. This model was created to replicate a structural test in order to validate the model and methodology for other purposes. The model was created from CAD geometry provided â€“ this modelled not only the panel section with bonded stringer, but also the test equipment along with nuts and bolts securing the panel to the test rig.</p>
						<p>Result: The outcomes of results at different pull-off load scenarios were compared with strain gauges placed at various positions on the test panel. The FEM had good correlated with the tests, resulting in a validated FE model and method.</p>
